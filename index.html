               <br>
               <p>The food alone is reason enough to book a trip to Athens. With succulent souvlaki, fresh Greek salads, and moussaka on the menu, it’s a foodie’s paradise.

                If you’re after traditional Greek cuisine, Klimataria is well worth a visit. This is one of the oldest taverns in the city, serving up authentic local dishes, with a side of Greek music and dancing.</p>
